# RCSTMNF

A map randomizer for TMNF (Trackmania Nations Forever)


## Installation

Installing all of the requirements.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Rexicon226/RCSTMNF.git
  cd RCSTMNF
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Installing Borderless Gaming.

Head over to the Borderless Gaming github and download the latest release.

https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming

Complete the setup process and launch the Borderless-Gaming exe.

## Use

Now launch TMNF and press ```Alt + Enter``` to exit fullscreen.
Using the edges, scale the window to be as large as possible. The 
taskbar will presist. Now return to the Borderless-Gaming app, in 
the left column select TmForever and press the second to lowest button
to create the borderless instance of the game. 

**Note: Making the game borderless is required for the RCSTMNF window to
be on top and visible. There is no way around this as of now.**

Launch the downloaded ```main.exe``` file and *hopefully* you will see a command
prompt and a main window. The window has no topbar, so you need to press and hold
anywhere black to move the window. The command prompt will display the TMX ID of the
played maps.

While on the TMNF homepage, click on the Start Challenge button and the first map will open.

**Note: The timer will countdown at first, but it will reset as soon as you can drive to compensate
for any network issues.**

Currently there is no support for medal detection and so you just press the ```next map``` button
once you have completed the author medal. There are definitly plans to add detection in the future.

Good luck with your challenge!




## FAQ

#### What is the point?

To compete through a test of luck and skill!

#### Why did you make this?

I needed an excuse to not do homework. Also I think it is an 
interesting test of coding knowledge.

#### What are the future plans for this?

I want to bring this tool to the same level as the TM2020 version.
There is infinitly less support for plugins in TMNF so it might not be 
possible.




## Roadmap

- Medal detection for a fairer and easier to use system.

- Use without the need to make the game borderless.
